---
The video titled "Fine Tuning Large Language Models with PEFT and LoRa" discusses the challenges and solutions in fine-tuning large language models, focusing on parameter-efficient techniques like PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning) and LoRa (Low Rank Adaptation).

## Takeaways
1. 🏋️ **Large Model Challenges**: Training large language models involves handling massive weights, requiring extensive compute resources.
2. 💾 **File Size Concerns**: As models grow, file sizes become unwieldy, with checkpoints reaching sizes of 40 GB and more.
3. 🚀 **PEFT Approach**: PEFT offers a solution by fine-tuning only a small number of additional weights while freezing most of the original parameters.
4. 🧠 **LoRa Technique**: LoRa, a method within PEFT, involves adding low-rank matrices to adapt models without retraining all weights.
5. 📉 **Catastrophic Forgetting**: PEFT helps prevent catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their original training when fine-tuned excessively.
6. 🛠 **Technique Applications**: PEFT, and LoRa are applied to various models, including AI art models like stable diffusion.
7. 📊 **Efficient Checkpoints**: PEFT results in smaller checkpoints, reducing storage needs significantly.
8. 🌐 **Hugging Face Integration**: PEFT techniques are implemented in Hugging Face's library, facilitating their use with existing pre-trained models.
9. 💻 **Practical Implementation**: The video demonstrates fine-tuning a model using PEFT and LoRa in a Python notebook.
10. 🤖 **Custom Adaptations**: PEFT allows for tailored model fine-tuning to specific tasks, even with limited data.
